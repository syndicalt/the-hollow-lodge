# The Hollow Lodge Operations

## Railway Services

The production Railway project has two services:

- `hollow-lodge-server` serves `https://server.thehollowlodge.com`.
- `the-hollow-lodge` serves `https://www.thehollowlodge.com`.

Deploy the server from the repository root:

```sh
railway up --service hollow-lodge-server --detach
```

Deploy the public site from the `site/` directory:

```sh
railway up site --path-as-root --service the-hollow-lodge --detach
```

## Health Checks

```sh
curl -fsS https://server.thehollowlodge.com/health
curl -fsS https://server.thehollowlodge.com/diagnostics
curl -fsSIL https://www.thehollowlodge.com/install.sh
```

`/diagnostics` reports provider readiness, event-log path/status, and data
directory without returning API keys, admin tokens, invite codes, or player
tokens.

## Access Requests

Players without an invite request access during onboarding:

```sh
hollow-lodge onboard --name Ada --contact ada@example.com
```

Admins review and approve requests with:

```sh
hollow-lodge admin key-requests
hollow-lodge admin key-request-approve key_request_0001
```

The approval command prints the one-use invite code once. The authoritative
event log stores only invite hashes.

## Inventory And Player Lookup

```sh
hollow-lodge admin invites
hollow-lodge admin players
```

Invite inventory never prints raw invite codes. Player lookup never prints
tokens or token hashes.

## Event-Log Integrity And Export

Verify the authoritative event log:

```sh
hollow-lodge admin event-log-verify
```

Export a JSON backup:

```sh
hollow-lodge admin event-log-export --output backups/hollow-lodge-events.json
```

Treat exports as sensitive operational data. They include server-visible events
and hashed auth material, but not raw player tokens, raw generated invite codes,
or admin tokens.

## Clean Install Smoke

On a clean machine with `uv` installed:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://www.thehollowlodge.com/install.sh | sh
```

The installer installs the CLI, registers the Codex MCP server, and launches
`hollow-lodge onboard`. Players with an invite can register immediately.
Players without an invite remain in pending onboarding state until an admin
approves their access request and sends them the generated invite code.
